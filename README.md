## 🧠 How It Works
Tkinter GUI displays the interface and handles user interactions.

Pygame mixer loads and plays audio files (MP3/WAV).

Controls manage playback (play, pause, stop, next, prev) and volume.

A progress bar updates in real-time to reflect playback time.

## 📝 Customization Tips
Add your own music files in the designated folder.

Modify the Tkinter layout, add theme or styling changes.

Extend support for features like shuffle, repeat, or equalizer.
